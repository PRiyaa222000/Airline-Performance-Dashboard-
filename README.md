# Airline-Performance-Dashboard-
I recently had the opportunity to work on an Airline Performance Dashboard, designed to provide actionable insights into flight operations. This tool empowers airlines to analyze performance, identify trends, and make data-driven decisions to enhance efficiency and customer satisfaction.

Key Insights:
📊 Total Flights: Over 2 million flights tracked for analysis.
⏱️ Delayed Flights: Approximately 790,000 delays, spotlighting improvement areas.
🚫 Canceled Flights: Around 29,000 cancellations, impacting operations and passenger experience.

Data Visualizations:
✔️ Delayed by Airlines: A bar chart ranking airlines by delay rates, pinpointing operational bottlenecks.
✔️ Flights by City: Highlights high-traffic cities and potential congestion hotspots.
✔️ Cancellations by Day: Analyzes daily patterns in cancellations for trend identification.
✔️ Cancellation Reasons: A pie chart breaking down reasons like weather, technical issues, or operational challenges.
✔️ On-Time, Delayed, Canceled: Provides an overall performance snapshot, revealing opportunities for improvement.

Next Steps:
🔧 Reduce Delays: Improve scheduling, resource allocation, and communication.
🚀 Minimize Cancellations: Address root causes like maintenance, staffing, and contingency planning.
💼 Enhance Passenger Experience: Focus on timely updates, transparent communication, and alternative travel solutions.
This dashboard underscores the power of data analytics in streamlining airline operations, improving performance, and enhancing customer satisfaction.
